# Materia-usp

 For the main results of the project, please look at the folder 'organized files'. These files have comments about the thought process behind the implementation.

 We made a lot of experiments with the features and with the dataset itself(which features to put in and which ones to not bother extracting and adding to the dataframe in the first place). These experiments can be found in the 'unorganized files' folder. But they are unorganized, little commented code and random things.
